## Important Notice of ACP Terms

Avalanche Community Proposals (ACPs) are a mechanism available to the Avalanche Community to propose new features, collect technical input and feedback, and document design decisions affecting the Avalanche network. With collective input and collaboration, the Avalanche Network will reflect the values and decisions of the Avalanche Community.

For mutual protection and enjoyment, the following terms are binding on and deemed agreed upon by all participants in the ACP process, no matter how much or little you participate:

1. **This is a collaborative community.** Treat all participants and the ACP process and all related comments, proposals and information with respect.
2. **No representations or warranties of any kind.** Anything that is posted as or about an ACP is posted without representations, warranties or guarantees of any kind and does not subject any participant to liability to other participants, except in the case of fraud, violation of law, or willful misconduct. Remember to check the date on everything, as what you read may be outdated.
3. **No centralized authority created.** The ACP process and all related comments, proposals and information is about software and community development. Nothing about it, in whole or part, creates any type of entity, partnership, business or other association, decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), or other type of affiliation that would cause some or all participants to be liable or responsible for the acts or omissions of anyone else.
4. **This is a public forum.** This means that you should not post:
    1. anything you want to keep confidential;
    2. anything you do not want to share or let others use; or
    3. any idea in which you want to have ownership rights, including intellectual property rights.
5. **Be polite to your fellow Avalanche Community members.** Your feedback on an ACP is absolutely welcomed, but attacking or insulting a fellow member of the community is not.  And do not lie.  These [guidelines](https://forum.avax.network/guidelines) are a useful reference for posts and discussion.
6. **Be responsible!**  For what you propose and say; for your own cybersecurity; for the network and all its components; for the community; for your conduct.
7. **DO NOT participate if you are conducting unlawful activities** (such as crimes or money laundering), are subject to sanctions, or otherwise up to no good (e.g., trying to hack the network, any smart contract or application, or any participant).
8. **Do NOT solicit money or free stuff from participants.** Do not publicize giveaways.
9. **No offer or sale of tokens.**  Nothing that occurs in the ACP process should be interpreted or deemed as an offer or sale of any token(s); any type of investment, accounting, tax or other advice; or an offer or sale of any type of asset, whether or not a financial instrument.  Do NOT use anything about an ACP to offer or sell tokens, securities or anything else.
10. Like all members of the Avalanche Community, neither Ava Labs, Inc. or the Avalanche Foundation Limited are responsible for anything related to an ACP. **Please read this [notice](https://www.avax.network/important-notice) and this [notice](https://www.avalabs.org/important-notice) carefully for more information.**

These terms are incorporated by reference into the repo; each ACP; all comments, oppositions and other posts and communications about an ACP, the ACP process and all repos associated with any ACP.

**The maintainers of this repository reserve the right to suspend access at any time, especially if you do not follow these terms.**
