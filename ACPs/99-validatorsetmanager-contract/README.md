## Abstract

Define (i) a reference interface for a minimal Validator Manager Solidity smart contract to be deployed on any Avalanche EVM chain, as well as (ii) a modular architecture to easily plug in custom “security modules” on top of this contract (e.g. to implement a PoS Subnet).

This ACP relies on concepts introduced in [ACP-77 (Reinventing Subnets)](https://github.com/avalanche-foundation/ACPs/tree/main/ACPs/77-reinventing-subnets). It depends on it to be marked as `Implementable`.

## Motivation

[ACP-77 (Reinventing Subnets)](https://github.com/avalanche-foundation/ACPs/tree/main/ACPs/77-reinventing-subnets) opens the door to managing an L1 validator set (stored on the P-Chain) from any chain on the Avalanche Network. The P-Chain allows a Subnet to specify a "validator manager". This `(blockchainID, address)` pair is responsible for sending Warp messages contained within `RegisterL1ValidatorTx` and `SetL1ValidatorWeightTx` on the P-Chain. This enables an on-chain program to add, modify the weight of, and remove validators.

On each validator set change, the P-Chain is willing to sign an `AddressedCall` to notify any on-chain program tracking the validator set. On-chain programs must be able to interpret this message, so they can trigger the appropriate action. The 2 kinds of `AddressedCall`s [defined in ACP-77](https://github.com/avalanche-foundation/ACPs/tree/main/ACPs/77-reinventing-subnets#p-chain-warp-message-payloads) are `L1ValidatorRegistrationMessage` and `L1ValidatorWeightMessage`.

Given these assumptions and the fact that most of the active blockchains on Avalanche mainnet are EVM-based, we propose defining a reference implementation for a Solidity smart contract that can:

1. Hold relevant information about the current Subnet validator set, as well as historical information
2. Send validator set updates to the P-Chain by generating `AdressedCall`s defined in ACP-77
3. Correctly update the validator set by interpreting notification messages received from the P-Chain
4. Be easily extended with custom “security modules” to implement any security model (e.g. PoS). Those modules have to implement the `IACP99SecurityModule` interface and will be called by the `ACP99Manager` contract upon validator set updates.

Having an audited and open-source reference implementation freely available will contribute to lowering the cost of launching Subnets on Avalanche.

Once deployed, the `ACP99Manager` contract will be used as the `Address` in the [`ConvertSubnetToL1Tx`](https://github.com/avalanche-foundation/ACPs/tree/main/ACPs/77-reinventing-subnets#convertsubnettol1tx).

## Specification

**Note:** The naming convention followed for the interfaces and contracts are inspired from the way [OpenZeppelin Contracts](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/) are named after ERC standards, using `ACP` instead of `ERC`.

### IACP99Manager

Here is the proposed interface for the `IACP99Manager` contract:

**Note:** The NodeIDs are stored as `bytes32` in the `ACP99Manager` interface to simplify the implementation.

#### About `Validation`s

A `Validation` represents the continuous time frame during which a node is part of the validator set and can be composed of multiple periods. A new period starts every time the validator weight changes during the same validation.

Each `Validation` is identified by its `validationID` which is the SHA256 of the Payload of the `AddressedCall` in the `RegisterL1ValidatorTx` adding the validator to the Subnet's validator set, as defined in ACP-77.

#### About `DisableL1ValidatorTx`

This transaction allows the `DisableOwner` of a validator to disable it directly from the P-Chain to claim the unspent `Balance` linked to the validation of a failed L1. Therefore it is not meant to be called in the `Manager` contract.

### IACP99SecurityModule

Here is the proposed interface for the `IACP99SecurityModule` contract:

```solidity
/**
 * @notice Information about a validator registration
 * @param nodeID The NodeID of the validator node
 * @param validationID The ValidationID of the validation
 * @param weight The initial weight assigned to the validator
 * @param startTime The timestamp when the validation started
 */
struct ValidatorRegistrationInfo {
    bytes32 nodeID;
    bytes32 validationID;
    uint64 weight;
    uint64 startTime;
}

/**
 * @notice Information about a change in a validator's weight
 * @param nodeID The NodeID of the validator node
 * @param validationID The ValidationID of the validation
 * @param nonce A sequential number to order weight changes
 * @param newWeight The new weight assigned to the validator
 * @param uptime The uptime information for the validator
 */
struct ValidatorWeightChangeInfo {
    bytes32 nodeID;
    bytes32 validationID;
    uint64 nonce;
    uint64 newWeight;
    ValidatorUptimeInfo uptimeInfo;
}

/*
 * @title IACP99SecurityModule
 * @author ADDPHO
 * @notice The IACP99SecurityModule interface is the interface for the ACP99 security modules.
 * @custom:security-contact security@suzaku.network
 */
interface IACP99SecurityModule {
    error ACP99SecurityModule__ZeroAddressManager();
    error ACP99SecurityModule__OnlyManager(address sender, address manager);

    /// @notice Get the address of the ACP99Manager contract secured by this module
    function getManagerAddress() external view returns (address);

    /**
     * @notice Handle a validator registration
     * @param validatorInfo The information about the validator
     */
    function handleValidatorRegistration(
        ValidatorRegistrationInfo memory validatorInfo
    ) external;

    /**
     * @notice Handle a validator weight change
     * @param weightChangeInfo The information about the validator weight change
     */
    function handleValidatorWeightChange(
        ValidatorWeightChangeInfo memory weightChangeInfo
    ) external;
}
```

### Reference Architecture

Each `ACP99Manager` contract will be associated with one "security module" that must implement the `IACP99SecurityModule` interface and is the only contract allowed to call the `ACP99Manager` functions related to validator set changes (`initiateValidatorRegistration`, and `initiateValidatorWeightUpdate`). Every time a validator is added/removed or a weight change is initiated, the `ACP99Manager` will in turn call the corresponding function of the "security module" (`handleValidatorRegistration` or `handleValidatorWeightChange`). We recommend that the "security module" reference an immutable `ACP99Manager` contract address for security reasons.

It is up to the "security module" to decide what action to take when a validator is added/removed or a weight change is confirmed by the P-Chain. Such actions could be starting the withdrawal period and allocating rewards in a PoS Subnet.

```mermaid

  Safe -->|addValidator| SecurityModule
  SecurityModule -->|initiateValidatorRegistration| Manager
  Manager -->|sendWarpMessage| P
  P -->|completeValidatorRegistration| Manager
  Manager -->|handleValidatorRegistration| SecurityModule
```

"Security modules" could implement PoS, Liquid PoS, etc. The specification of such smart contracts is out of the scope of this ACP.

## Backwards Compatibility

The `IACP99Manager` and `IACP99SecurityModule` interfaces are only a reference interface, they don’t have any impact on the current behavior of the Avalanche protocol.

## Reference Implementation

A work in progress reference implementation is available in the [Suzaku Contracts Library](https://github.com/suzaku-network/suzaku-contracts-library/blob/acp-99-implementation/README.md#acp99-contracts-library) repository. It will be updated until this ACP is considered `Implementable` based on the outcome of the discussion.

## Security Considerations

The audit process of the `ACP99Manager` contract is of the utmost importance for the future of the Avalanche ecosystem as most Subnets would rely upon it to secure their Subnet.

## Open Questions

### Is there an interest to keep historical information about the validator set on the manager chain?

The functions `getValidation` and `getValidatorValidations` would allow to retrieve historical information about the validator set directly from state, notably each validator's performance (uptime) during past validations.
If we don't keep track of the historical information in the `ACP99Manager` contract, this information will still be available in archive nodes and offchain tools (e.g. explorers).

### Is an upgradeable architecture more appropriate?

The Teleporter team has been working on its own implementation of a `ValidatorManager` contract in the [teleporter](https://github.com/ava-labs/teleporter/blob/main/contracts/validator-manager/ValidatorManager.sol) repository that is based on abstract and upgradeable contracts.

### Should the `ACP99Manager` include a churn control mechanism?

The Teleporter team implentation of the `ValidatorManager` contract includes a churn control mechanism that prevents too much weight from being added or removed from the validator set in a short amount of time.

### How could we name “Security Modules”?

I don’t really like this name but cannot come up with anything else.
